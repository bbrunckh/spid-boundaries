# Boundaries for subnational household surveys

This repository includes R scripts to produce boundary data corresponding with the World Bank Subnational Poverty and Inequality Database (SPID). 

The boundary data is used to map the SPID, the Global Subnational Atlas of Poverty (GSAP) and to estimate the population at high risk from climate-related hazards.

## Computational and software requirments

## Description of code
1. Prepare admin-0 data using official world bank country polygons.
2. Prepare non-standard subnational boundary data-files
3. Combine subnational boundaries based on SPID master list
 - prepare source boundary data
 - get unmodified boundaries
 - construct modified boundaries
 - get missing subnational boundaries
 - clip to Official WB admin-0 polygons
4. Edge-match subnational boundaries to WB admin-0 polygons
