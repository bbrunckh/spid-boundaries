# Boundaries for subnational household survey samples

This repository includes R scripts to produce boundary data corresponding with the World Bank Subnational Poverty and Inequality Database (SPID). 

The boundary data is used to map the SPID, the Global Subnational Atlas of Poverty (GSAP) and to estimate the population at high risk from climate-related hazards.
